# Advent of Code 2023

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/).

To install:
```
pnpm i
spago build
```

I haven't bothered with a CLI/Main yet. To run solutions (eg. for day 5):
```sh
$ spago repl
> import Day05
> solve1 example
> solve1 <$> input
```

Inputs files are expected at eg. `input/05.txt`.
